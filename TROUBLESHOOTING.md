## Android Studio Emulator Issues

### Issue: Emulator Won't Start

**Symptoms:**
- Emulator shows loading screen but never fully boots
- Error message "The emulator process for AVD has terminated"
- Black screen after launching emulator

**Solutions:**

1. **Check Available RAM:**
   ```bash
   # Check system memory
   system_profiler SPHardwareDataType | grep Memory
   
   # Reduce emulator RAM if needed (in AVD Manager)
   # Recommended: 4GB for 8GB systems, 8GB for 16GB+ systems
   ```

2. **Enable Hardware Acceleration:**
   ```bash
   # For Intel Macs - Install HAXM
   # Download from: https://github.com/intel/haxm/releases
   
   # For Apple Silicon Macs - Ensure Hypervisor is enabled
   # This is usually enabled by default
   ```

3. **Clean and Recreate AVD:**
   ```bash
   # List AVDs
   avdmanager list avd
   
   # Delete problematic AVD
   avdmanager delete avd -n <avd_name>
   
   # Create new AVD with different settings
   ```

4. **Check System Image Compatibility:**
   - Intel Macs: Use x86 or x86_64 images
   - Apple Silicon Macs: Use ARM64 images
